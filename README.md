# Jumper
Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time. The player guesses the letter in the puzzle, if the guess is correct, the letter is revealed. If not correct, the player loses a line in their parachute. The game is over when the puzzle is complete or when the player has no more parachute.
